## Developer Task

Within around two hours (more or less):

1. Build a web page which looks like this design(https://xd.adobe.com/view/87381659- 6068-45c3-976a-a3c6152ab280-d26b/) using React (we are interested in desktop view only).

2. There is a starter project that uses Gatsby, React and typescript on this link. (You may also use one without typescript, but we use typescript exclusively on our projects inhouse.)

Some options for including CSS are Tailwind, styled components or Sass. You can choose which ever you are most comfortable with, but we tend to use tailwind for out projects.

3. For the second layer of the page, we would like you to use your creativity to animate the fruit and vegetables when the section comes into view (you will find the required images in the starter folder).
